title: "Teaching"
---

I teach across the MA and BA programs on topics that I am passionate about. I try to create a safe and positive atmosphere around the course—a good sense of community and psychological safety in the classroom. Another key element for me in teaching is listening—getting a sense of where each student is at in their learning. I usually have a model of the course learning that we revisit each week, aligned with learning goals.
