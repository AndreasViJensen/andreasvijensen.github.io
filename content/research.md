    <div class="paper-abstract"><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>It is a long-standing view that educational institutions sustain democracy by building an engaged citizenry. However, recent scholarship has seriously questioned whether going to college increases political participation. While these studies have been ingenious in using natural experiments to credibly estimate the causal effect of college, most have produced estimates with high statistical uncertainty. I contend that college matters: I argue that, together, prior effect estimates are just as compatible with a positive effect as a null effect. Furthermore, analyzing two-panel datasets of young US voters, using a well-powered difference-in-differences design, I find that attending college leads to a substantive increase in voter turnout. Importantly, these findings are consistent with the statistically uncertain but positive estimates in previous studies. This calls for updating our view of the education-participation relationship, suggesting that statistical uncertainty in prior studies may have concealed that college education has substantive civic returns.</p></details></div>

    <div class="paper-title">How Education Increases Political Participation: Voter Turnout, Peer Exposure and Resource Accumulation Across College Fields of Study</div>
    <div class="paper-meta"><strong>Paper (conditionally accepted)</strong> · <em>Journal of Politics</em></div>
    <div class="paper-abstract"><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>Education is generally considered a key institution in democracies and formative for citizens’ political participation. While prior research has identified when college education increases voter turnout, the underlying mechanisms remain largely a “black box”. I address this gap by studying causally credible variation in the field – rather than length – of education. Theories suggest that college majors impact political participation through peer composition, academic content, or economic returns. I test these theories using regression discontinuities in Danish college admissions, finding that enrollment in social sciences, humanities and health fields increases voter turnout among their applicants, whereas this appears not to be the case for science/STEM fields. Crucially, turnout-stimulating fields do not raise income, but increase exposure to voting peers by 6–10 percent or exposure to human-centered content. This highlights college as an important arena for political socialization and suggests a potential trade-off between the economic and civic returns of higher education.</p></details></div>

    <div class="paper-title">Candidate Education and Voting Preferences: How Voters Prefer Politicians Who Share Their Educational Background</div>
    <div class="paper-meta"><strong>Working paper</strong> · with Mathias Kruse</div>
    <div class="paper-abstract"><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>There is growing consensus that voters prefer higher-educated political candidates, and that this preference explains the under-representation of lower-educated politicians in parliaments across democracies. We argue, in contrast, that ingroup favoritism should lead voters to prefer political candidates with a similar education background, and that examining and explaining such same-group preference require more subtle methodological designs. We fielded four large-scale survey experiments in Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Germany where we i) presented respondents with ingroup candidates who share their educational background and ii) randomly assigned information about candidates’ competence, warmth, and policy appeal to test different causal mechanisms. We find that both higher- and lower-educated voters prefer same-group candidates, and that this preference is partly driven by inferences related to candidates’ competence, warmth, and policy appeal. These findings demonstrate that in a European setting, the over-representation of higher-educated politicians in office is not driven by a universal demand.</p></details></div>

    <div class="paper-title">Socialization or Status? Disentangling Early-Life Barriers to Immigrant Integration</div>
    <div class="paper-meta"><strong>Working paper</strong> · with Mathias Kruse</div>
    <div class="paper-abstract"><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>How do immigrants become integrated in their country of residence? We argue that barriers to integration emerge already in childhood. Specifically, we combine political socialization theory with a novel argument grounded in theories of boundary-drawing to distinguish three potential barriers: Young immigrants are exposed to a different society, their parents lack experiences with the new society, and they have a status as “immigrant”. Using original data from more than 120,000 immigrants and descendants in Denmark, we examine how each of these affect turnout and naturalization later in life. Employing within-family sibling comparisons and a regression discontinuity design, we show that longer exposure to the origin country reduces voting and naturalization, that greater parental host-country experience increases both, and that simply being born an immigrant substantially lowers citizenship acquisition but not turnout. These findings demonstrate that immigrant integration is shaped by distinct barriers early in life with lasting consequences for democratic inclusion.</p></details></div>

    <div class="paper-title">From Voice to Vote? Encouraging Voters to Use Their Political Voice Has Positive and Negative Effects on Voter Turnout</div>
    <div class="paper-meta"><strong>Working paper</strong> · with Simon Calmar Andersen</div>
    <div class="paper-abstract"><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>A recent study found negative effects of a get-out-the-vote (GOTV) intervention for some groups of voters. This raises concerns that well-intentioned campaigns to increase turnout may risk demobilizing important parts of the demos. In an ethically approved GOTV field experiment in a local government election in Denmark (n≈90,000), we found positive effects on high-educated voters, but unexpectedly, negative effects among less educated voters. Comparing two treatment groups—one receiving an encouragement to voice opinions and one additionally receiving easier access to voicing—we find that providing access actually further decreased voting among less educated voters. Furthermore, we reanalyze prior GOTV studies which contain demographic data to study subgroup effect heterogeneity. Here we detect an additional negative GOTV subgroup effect, and find substantial heterogeneity between socio-demographic groups. Whereas these findings may be a coincidence, they are reported here so that future efforts to increase turnout may test for such unintended, negative subgroup effects.</p></details></div>

    <div class="paper-abstract"><details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>European Parliament (EP) elections are among the world’s largest democratic events, but they are challenging for voters. Campaigns address issues from the future of the polity to specific policies, with the Parliament holding more power over the latter. To understand what information voters need to act in their interest, we examine what they prioritize when accurately informed about the EP’s powers. We use field experimental data from two Voting Advice Applications embedded on a major Danish news site during the 2024 EP election. Users were told that the EP has more influence over policy than polity issues, chose whether to receive advice based on policy or polity preferences, and stated their vote intention before or after receiving advice. Analyzing 66,000 users and a representative survey experiment (n=2,951), we find that citizens prioritize policy over polity information under accurate information. These results have important implications for representation research, media and politicians.</p></details></div>
